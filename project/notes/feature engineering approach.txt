This document is to outline what feature engineering approaches I plan on implementing for this program. The primary objective of the program is to quickly and reliably analyze cryptocurrency data, create a set of features and seamlessly implement that data structure in a neural net for training.

/Basic Techniques/
1.Imputation
2.Handling Outliers
3.Binning
4.Log Transform
5.One-Hot Encoding
6.Grouping Operations
7.Feature Split
8.Scaling
9.Extracting Date

NOTE: DO NOT neglect the time_series of the dataset. pay attention to day, week, month, year, holidays, events, etc.

Since the LSTM data will be in sequences, visualizing any distributions will be hard and potentially unusable. The primary objective as I see it will be to 'squish' that data into fewer dimensions. for example, instead of having a list of price values I could calculate a trend line (regression line) of those prices. I could then incorporate features that show the standard deviation of the points distance from the regression line, slope, y intercept, time interval, etc.
