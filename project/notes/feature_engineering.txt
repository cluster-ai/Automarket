This section of development is to implement different ways to generate and store feature engineered data. Below is the next thing being developed for this.

/// | Feature Engineering Categories | ///

Thought: Nearly every raw historical data category may benefit from trend line analysis. Consider having 'elbows' in the regression lines for not only overal trend direction but also its change. (may have to use "binning" based on time_series to segregate data consistantly, see "feature engineering approach.txt")


//Time Series//
/column names/
 - time_period_start, time_period_end
/features/
 - Month, Day, Year
 - Day of Week
 - National Holidays, Countries Acknowledging Holiday
 - Time of Day (hour, min, sec)
 - Data Sequence Interval

//Average, High and Low Price//
/column names/
 - price_high, price_low, price_average
/features/
 - trend: (slope, y-intercept), deviation of points to trend line (linear regression)
 - High and Low difference (perhaps a way of showing volatility per datapoint or across an entire sequence (trend line))

//Volume Traded, Trades Count///
NOTE: without orderbook data, this category is not very detailed.
/column names/
 - volume_traded, trades_count
/features/
 - average trade size (volume_traded / trades_count)
 - trend: (slope, y-intercept), deviation of points to trend line (linear regression)
 - High and Low Volume or Trades Count difference (perhaps a way of showing volatility per datapoint or across an entire sequence (trend line))

 NOTE: Many of the features use a trend line. This works on a single
 	   interval but is not easily/helpfully used in sequence data.

 	   For now I will flatten noise and keep the format (tabular)


 /// | Feature Engineering Functions and Features | ///

 //Functions//
 /regression/
  - creates a regression line from historical data
  - this line is saved as slope, y-int, and interval
  	of dataframe index (time_period_start) in dict
