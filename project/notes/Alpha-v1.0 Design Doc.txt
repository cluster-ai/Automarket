Project Overview:
	Automarket-Feature_Dev is a tool for creating a financial model of 
	cryptocurrency markets using historical data from numerous exchanges. 
	The end goal is to provide the user with a workbench to create and 
	visualize custom features for use in financial modeling/analysis.

Context: 
	This program can be broken up into 5 distinct parts: market data api
	requests, custom feature creation, data vizualization, graphical user
	interface and data storage. The purpose of this document is to provide 
	a clear understanding of each part and elaborate on how they interact
	with each other from a high-level.
