Deadline: unclear

The main points to hit with this version is to separate the database and neural net training from the "client" machine and instead have it run through a server of some kind. The core of this functionality will use SQL as well as some backend on the server side to communicate with and deliver information to and from client effectively.

I noticed that modules being accessed by database.py cannot gather information from the database directly because of importing contradictions. For this version, separate the database and database controller from one another to aleviate this issue. This controller can have user input contralized to it rather than having it dispersed across the modules.

Questions:
- Since the datasets are small, perhaps the entire contents of the coins/exchanges being worked on can be loaded in their entirety? \
- Is it necessary or beneficial to preprocess the data from the server or the client?


What I want this program to look like:
- consolidate feature.py to new controller module
- move logic functions from database to new controller module,
this will allow coinapi.io to store its information on the 
database rather than its own file.
